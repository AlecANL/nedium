            In this article, I want to overview my list of the ten most critical
            frustrations and share practical tips on how to overcome them:
          </p>
          <h3>Small-sized text</h3>
          <p>
            Despite the recent popularity of video format, most information on
            the web is still in written form. That’s why
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>
              In this article, I want to overview my list of the ten most
              critical frustrations and share practical tips on how to overcome
              them:
            </span>
          </p>
          <p>
            Here are a few practical tips for you to follow when working with
            text:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Font size should be <span>minimum 16px.</span> 16px for body text
              is a good place to start but remember that the bigger the screen
              size, the larger the text.
            </li>
            <li>
              Aim for line-height to be 1.5em or 1.6em for optimal readability.
            </li>
            <li>Always view your designs on an actual device.</li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Tiny click targets</h3>
          <p>
            The smaller the interactive elements (links, buttons, and other UI
            controls), the more mistakes the user will make when interacting
            with your website.
          </p>
          <p>
            <span>Do not play ‘hunt a button’ game with your visitors.</span>
          </p>
          <img src="../assets/img/image2.png" alt="image 2" />
          <p>Here are a few good tips:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Touch targets should be finger-friendly. The average size of the
              touch target should be 9mm x 9mm. Material Design states that
              touch targets should be at least 48 x 48 px.
            </li>
            <li>
              Add good padding surrounding touch targets. Microsoft guidelines
              recommend 10mm paddings between touch targets.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>Not working “Back” button</h3>
          <p>
            User control and freedom is one of Jakob Nielsen’s 10 usability
            heuristic of user interface design. It says:
          </p>
          <p>
            <span
              >Users need a clearly marked “emergency exit” to leave the
              unwanted action without having to go through an extended
              process.</span
            >
          </p>
          <p>
            And the Back button in a browser is this emergency exit. If you are
            afraid that users will lose their data by clicking the Back button,
            it’s better to warn users about that by displaying a message “Your
            work will be lost"on the Back button click.
          </p>
          <pre>
window.addEventListener("beforeunload", function(event) { ... });

window.onbeforeunload = function(event) { 

// notify about potential data loss here

};
 
          </pre>
          <ul class="counter-list">
            <li>
              Font size should be <span>minimum 16px.</span> 16px for body text
              is a good place to start but remember that the bigger the screen
              size, the larger the text.
            </li>
            <li>
              Aim for line-height to be 1.5em or 1.6em for optimal readability.
            </li>
            <li>Always view your designs on an actual device.</li>
          </ul>
